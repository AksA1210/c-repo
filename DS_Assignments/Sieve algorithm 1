Sieve method, or the method of sieves, can mean:

    in mathematics and computer science, the sieve of Eratosthenes, a simple method for finding prime numbers
        in number theory, any of a variety of methods studied in sieve theory
        in combinatorics, the set of methods dealt with in sieve theory or more specifically, the inclusion–exclusion principle
    in statistics, and particularly econometrics, the use of sieve estimators
    
    
There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100.

There are 21 prime numbers between 101 to 200.

There are 16 prime numbers between 201 and 300.

Prime numbers become less common as numbers get larger.
“Twin primes” are primes that are exactly two apart. Some twin primes are 3 and 5, 5 and 7, 11 and 13, 17 and 19, 29 and 31, …. (Can you find all the twin primes up to 200?)

There is only one set called “Triplet primes”: 3, 5, 7.

1.
	Cross out 1 (it is not a prime).
2.
	Start with 2. Circle 2 as a prime number, but cross out all multiples of 2 (every even number).
3.
	Now, move to the next prime 3. Circle 3 as a prime number, but cross out any multiple of 3 remaining in the chart.
4.
	Now, move to 5. Circle 5 as a prime number, but cross out any multiple of 5 remaining in the chart.
5.
	Now, move to 7. Circle 7 as a prime number, but cross out any multiple of 7 remaining in the chart. encircle 11 cross out
  multiples of 11.
6.
	Continue this process for each prime number you encounter on the chart. Remember that a prime is divisible only by 1 and itself.
7.
	The circled values in the chart are the prime numbers between 1 and 100.
